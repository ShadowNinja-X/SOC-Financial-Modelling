## Introduction ## 
The instruction began with an intro pdf which included important basics about finnancial systems strategies different types of interests.
## Assignment 1 ## 
The week 1 involved more in depth information of different financial instruments, video lectures on statistical variables and coding resources for python and jupyter.
The assignment was to write a code to find different ratios of stocks by donwloading their data from yahoo finance and i did it taking help from the mentors and chatGPT when i got stuck at the coding portion and then asked the mentor to help me out in certain places where i lacked.
## Assignment 2 ##
Week 2 involved knowledge on bonds and videos root finding algorithms.
The assignment 2.1 was to compare the different root finding methods on rate of convergernce and the number of iterations for convergence for some given functions.
The assignment 2.2 was to write a python program to take inputs and give the yield to maturity of a bond and test the working of it with some examples, here i faced a bit of an issue but the mentors helped me out in that and it got sorted.
